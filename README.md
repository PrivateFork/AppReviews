# App Reviews

App Reviews make it super simple for developers and other interested to keep track of new user reviews to iPhone apps.

App Reviews run in your statusbar and notifies you when there are new reviews.

Please have a look at the [Project site](http://knutigro.github.io/App-Reviews-OSX/) for binaries and more info.
